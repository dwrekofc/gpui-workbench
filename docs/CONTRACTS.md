# Component Contracts

Component contracts are the machine-readable metadata schema describing a component's props, states, tokens, interaction checklist, performance evidence, and required files.

## Schema

The `ComponentContract` struct is defined in `crates/components/` and serializes to JSON for registry and CLI consumption.

See `specs/component-contracts.md` for full specification.
